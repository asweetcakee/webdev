## Full Stack Open 2025 â€” Part 3
This folder contains my **backend and frontend solutions** for **Part 3 exercises** of the Full Stack Open course.
  
Each solved exercise is committed using the following convention:
> `Completed [exercise number]: [exercise name]. [what was done in the exercise]`
